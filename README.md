# Portfolio Project

This project is a responsive website that I created as part of my freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. The website is used to showcase my other projects and functions as a portfolio. The design is based on the freeCodeCamp example for this project. I used HTML5 and CSS3 to construct the website.
